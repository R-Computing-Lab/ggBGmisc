of functions for visualizing and analyzing pedigree data. It is designed
to work seamlessly with the BGmisc package, which provides tools for
simulating, manipulating, and modeling pedigree data.

### Branching and Versioning System

The development of ggBGmisc follows a [GitFlow branching
strategy](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/topics/automation/version-control/advanced-git/git-branching-strategies/):

- **Feature Branches**: All major changes and new features should be
  developed on separate branches created from the dev branch. Name these
  branches according to the feature or change they are meant to address.
- **Development Branches**: Our approach includes two development
  branches, each serving distinct roles:
  - **`dev`**: This branch is the final integration stage before changes
    are merged into the `main` branch. It is considered stable, and only
    well-tested features and updates that are ready for the next release
    cycle are merged here.
- **Main Branch** (`main`): The main branch mirrors the stable state of
  the project as seen on CRAN. Only fully tested and approved changes
  from the dev_main branch are merged into main to prepare for a new
  release.
