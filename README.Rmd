### Branching and Versioning System
The development of ggBGmisc follows a [GitFlow branching strategy](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/topics/automation/version-control/advanced-git/git-branching-strategies/):

- **Feature Branches**: All major changes and new features should be developed on separate branches created from the dev_main branch. Name these branches according to the feature or change they are meant to address.
- **Development Branches**: Our approach includes two development branches, each serving distinct roles:
  - **`dev`**: This branch is the final integration stage before changes are merged into the `main` branch. It is considered stable, and only well-tested features and updates that are ready for the next release cycle are merged here.
- **Main Branch** (`main`): The main branch mirrors the stable state of the project as seen on CRAN. Only fully tested and approved changes from the dev_main branch are merged into main to prepare for a new release.
